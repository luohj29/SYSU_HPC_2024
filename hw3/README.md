# SYSU HPC 2024FALL lab2(from 0 to count)
illustraion: using phread to preactise parallel programming
## task0:
    background: to circulate compute and timing with condion [1,8] threads and [128,256...2048] size matrix mulltiplication;
    usage: make 

## task1:
    background: compute and timing  the sum caculation of a 1000 size num_group
    usage: ./task1

## task2:   
    background: compute the ax^2+bx+c=0 solution
    tips: both task2 and test is workable just the mutex different
    usage: ./task2 a, b, c

## task3:   
    background: compute the area beneath the  curve y=x^2  between [0,1]    
    usage: ./task2 num_thread, sample size;
